Using the **Jib Maven Plugin** to containerize and run your Angular app is a slightly different approach compared to a `Dockerfile`. Jib allows you to build container images directly from your Maven project without needing a `Dockerfile` or even having Docker installed locally.

However, **Jib** is primarily designed for containerizing Java applications. Since Angular is a front-end framework and typically produces static assets (like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS), you will need to follow an approach where **Jib** is used indirectly, by combining your Angular app with a backend server (like **Spring Boot**), which Jib can containerize.

Below are two scenarios depending on your setup:

1. **Angular app with no backend (served using NGINX)**: Use a Dockerfile (recommended in this case).
2. **Angular app bundled with a Spring Boot backend (using Jib)**: Use the Jib Maven plugin.

I'll focus on the second scenario where you have a **Spring Boot backend** and want to bundle the Angular app and then containerize the combined application using Jib.

### Step 1: Build Angular and Copy to Spring Boot Static Resources

First, configure your project to build your Angular app and copy the built static files to the Spring Boot `static` folder.

1. Build the Angular app with the following command:

    ```bash
    ng build --prod
    ```

    This will generate the production build of your Angular app inside the `dist/your-angular-app` folder.

2. Copy the contents of `dist/your-angular-app` to your Spring Boot applicationâ€™s `src/main/resources/static/` folder.

This way, your Spring Boot application will serve the Angular files as static assets when the application runs.

### Step 2: Use Maven to Automate the Angular Build and Copy

To automate the process of building the Angular app and copying the build output to the Spring Boot resources folder during the Maven build process, you can add a **frontend-maven-plugin** to the Spring Boot `pom.xml`.

Here's how to modify the `pom.xml` of your Spring Boot project to include the steps for building Angular and copying the output:

```xml
<project>
    <!-- Spring Boot dependencies, plugins, etc. -->

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <!-- Jib Maven Plugin for building the container image -->

                <configuration>
                    <!-- Name of the image to build -->
                    <to>
                        <image>your-dockerhub-username/my-spring-angular-app</image>
                    </to>
                    <!-- Expose necessary ports -->
                    <container>
                        <ports>
                            <port>8080</port>
                        </ports>
                    </container>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>

### Explanation:

1. **Jib Plugin**: 
    - The Jib plugin is configured to build and push a Docker image to your Docker registry (like DockerHub).
    - It is configured to expose port `8080` (which is the default for Spring Boot).

2. **Frontend Maven Plugin**: 
    - This plugin installs Node.js and NPM, installs dependencies, and builds the Angular application.
    - It then copies the generated Angular build from `dist/your-angular-app` into the Spring Boot resources folder (`src/main/resources/static`), so Spring Boot can serve these static files.

### Step 3: Create the NPM Script to Copy Angular Build to Spring Boot

In the root of your Angular project (`frontend/` directory), modify the `package.json` to add a script to copy the Angular build files to the Spring Boot `static` folder:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "ng serve",
    "build": "ng build",
    "test": "ng test",
    "lint": "ng lint",
    "e2e": "ng e2e",
    "copy-to-backend": "cp -r dist/your-angular-app/* $BUILD_DESTINATION"
  }
}
```

This script (`copy-to-backend`) will copy the Angular build files from the `dist` folder to the destination directory defined by the Maven configuration.

### Step 4: Build the Container with Jib

Now that everything is configured, you can build the Docker image using the **Jib Maven Plugin**. Since Jib doesn't require Docker to be installed locally, it simplifies the containerization process.

Run the following Maven command to build and push your image:

```bash
mvn clean install jib:build
```

This will:

1. Build the Angular project.
2. Copy the Angular build to the Spring Boot static folder.
3. Containerize the combined Spring Boot + Angular application using Jib.
4. Push the Docker image to your Docker registry (such as DockerHub).

### Step 5: Run the Container

Once the image is built and pushed to your Docker registry, you can pull and run the container using Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 your-dockerhub-username/my-spring-angular-app
```

This command maps port `8080` on your local machine to port `8080` in the container, allowing you to access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Conclusion

By using the **Jib Maven Plugin**, you can easily containerize and deploy a combined Spring Boot and Angular application without needing a `Dockerfile`. Jib simplifies the build process, automatically pushing the image to your Docker registry.

If you want to serve a standalone Angular application using **NGINX** or another server, it's generally easier to stick with a `Dockerfile` approach, but for a Spring Boot + Angular project, Jib provides a smooth and integrated workflow.
